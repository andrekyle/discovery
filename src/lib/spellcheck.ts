/**
 * Lightweight, in‑browser spell checker used to give students feedback on
 * their typed exercise answers.
 *
 * Strategy — high precision, low false‑positive rate:
 *   1. Maintain curated dictionaries: common + extended English, business /
 *      workplace vocabulary, and IT / hardware / software / networking
 *      terminology students are expected to use.
 *   2. A word is only reported as misspelled when it looks like a *typo* of a
 *      dictionary word — i.e. there is at least one dictionary word within an
 *      edit distance of 1 (short words) or 2 (longer words).
 *      Unknown words that are *not* close to any dictionary entry (e.g. names,
 *      brands, acronyms, code identifiers, technical jargon that isn't in the
 *      list) are left alone rather than flagged as wrong.
 *   3. Callers may supply extra allowed words (e.g. terminology drawn from the
 *      current lesson's answer key) so lesson‑specific vocabulary is never
 *      flagged as a typo.
 *
 * Everything runs client‑side — no network calls, no external dictionaries. */
