        answer: 2,
        explain: "Numbering, titling and sourcing (e.g. 'Source: ServiceNow export, June 2026') make evidence traceable, and referring to the table in the text ties it into the argument.",

        q: "Why must the distribution of a confidential report be controlled?",
        options: [
          "To make the report seem more important",
          "Because POPIA, FSCA requirements and the bank's information-security policy require information to reach only its intended audience",
          "So that fewer copies need to be printed",
          "Because executive summaries are copyrighted",

Cape Town Tourism, in partnership with various stakeholders in the Province and the City of Cape Town, has adopted an active stance in developing and implementing a practical, effective and integrated Cape Town Safety & Security Plan, finalised timeously as the Festive Season kicks off as an extension of the Provincial Safety and Security Plan.",
          "In broad terms, the following aspects are addressed in the Cape Town Safety & Security Plan:",
          "1. Creating awareness of the importance of visitor safety and security.",
          "2. Proactively developing and maintaining a safe and secure environment for visitors.",
          "3. Developing and maintaining capacity via the members and staff of Cape Town Tourism, to react quickly and effectively to visitor related incidents.",

Every network of service providers has a role to play. Under the umbrella of the Department of Economic Development and Tourism's initiative, the Cape Town Safety & Security Plan promotes a practical partnership approach to tourism incident management\".",
          "\"Co-ordination and communication,\" du Toit went on to say, \"is the single most important aspect in the Cape Town Safety and Security Plan — in other words, an alignment that really works.\"",

          "She stressed the importance of using and reinforcing established and dedicated response mechanisms. These are:",
          "• Safety and Security incidents — 10111",
          "• Ambulance & Fire — 10177",
          "• Emergency services (other) — 107",
          "• Consumer complaints — 0800 007 081",
          "Much hard work has gone on behind the scenes, where strong relationships continue to be forged between the various safety and security role players. These partnerships will undertake the following combined tasks:",
          "• The ongoing monitoring of emergency response times.",
          "• Quantifying the success of the Cape Town Safety & Security Plan.",
          "• Identifying hotspots.",
          "• Embarking on joint awareness campaigns.",
          "• Ensuring that the Victim Support Programme is effectively utilized.",
          "Cape Town Tourism's membership base has been incorporated to further strengthen the Cape Town Safety & Security Plan: once incidents are reported to the dedicated response mechanisms, the relevant Cape Town Tourism Manager is contacted to ensure immediate activation of the Victim Support Programme. In addition, a Cape Town Tourism Membership Forum has been put in place that actively participates and feeds into the Cape Town and Provincial Safety and Security Forums. Members of Cape Town Tourism have also generously agreed to contribute to the Cape Town Tourism-run Band Aid Programme, which serves to provide additional services for feeding into the Victim Support Programme, for example accommodation, flights, tours, gifts and meal vouchers.",
          "Paramount to the Cape Town Safety & Security Plan is a zero tolerance approach towards crime. Communities throughout the Cape Town Metropole must claim their City back. In du Toit's words, \"No-one can afford to have the image of Cape Town tarnished. We desperately rely on tourism as a vehicle to spread economic benefits to all our people and as a means of improving living standards by creating sustainable employment opportunities.\"",
          "\"We rely on the people of Cape Town, the entire tourism industry and our law enforcement agencies to work together on this single most important challenge,\" she added. \"Ongoing awareness and communication that incorporates the citizens and communities of Cape Town is one of the most important aspects of the Safety & Security Plan.\" Summing things up succinctly, du Toit commented that Cape Town Tourism realises the importance of ongoing, year-round proactive and reactive programmes that can effectively turn a negative situation around and soften the blow. \"Cape Town is our home. As such, we all need to work together to make sure that she is safe so we can truly enjoy her and share her with each other and visitors from the world over.\"",

          "The story of your job starts two hundred years ago, before electricity was in homes. In 1822 the English mathematician Charles Babbage designed the Difference Engine — a hand-cranked machine of brass gears built to calculate mathematical tables without human error. He then went further: his Analytical Engine (designed from 1837) had a 'mill' that did the arithmetic and a 'store' that held numbers — exactly the CPU-and-memory split every computer still uses today. It read its instructions from punched cards, an idea borrowed from the Jacquard loom, which since 1804 had woven silk patterns controlled by holes punched in cards.",
          "Ada Lovelace, a mathematician and the daughter of the poet Lord Byron, studied the Analytical Engine and in 1843 published a set of notes that included a step-by-step method for the machine to compute Bernoulli numbers — widely regarded as the first computer program ever written. More importantly, she saw what even Babbage did not: that a machine manipulating symbols could go beyond numbers and one day compose music or create art. She imagined general-purpose computing — and, in a sense, predicted today's AI — a century before the first computer was built.",
          "The punched card outlived them both. In 1890 Herman Hollerith used punched cards and electric tabulating machines to process the US census in two years instead of eight. His Tabulating Machine Company merged into what was renamed, in 1924, International Business Machines — IBM. Data processing was an industry before a single electronic computer existed.",

          "For most of history a 'computer' was a person — someone employed to do calculations by hand, and for a century that skilled, painstaking work was done overwhelmingly by women. At Harvard Observatory from the 1880s, a team of women 'computers' including Williamina Fleming, Annie Jump Cannon and Henrietta Swan Leavitt catalogued hundreds of thousands of stars; Leavitt's work became a foundation for measuring the universe.",
          "At NACA — later NASA — teams of women computed flight and rocket trajectories with pencils, slide rules and mechanical calculators. In the segregated 'West Area Computing' unit, Black women mathematicians did this work while being kept in separate offices: Katherine Johnson calculated the trajectory for America's first human spaceflight, and John Glenn refused to fly his 1962 orbital mission until she personally re-checked the electronic computer's figures — 'If she says they're good, then I'm ready to go.' Dorothy Vaughan became NASA's first Black supervisor and, seeing electronic computers coming, taught herself and her whole team FORTRAN programming. Mary Jackson became NASA's first Black female engineer. Their story is told in the film Hidden Figures.",
          "During the Second World War, hundreds of women computed artillery firing tables for the US Army — and at Bletchley Park in Britain, where Alan Turing's team broke the German Enigma cipher with electromechanical 'bombe' machines, roughly three quarters of the ten-thousand-strong workforce were women, many operating Colossus (1943), the world's first programmable electronic digital computer.",
          "So when the first general-purpose electronic computer arrived, it was natural that women programmed it. ENIAC (1945) weighed 30 tons and used about 18,000 vacuum tubes; its six original programmers — Kay McNulty, Betty Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas and Ruth Lichterman — programmed it by physically re-plugging cables and setting switches, with no manuals and no training course, inventing programming as a discipline as they went. For decades their role was almost forgotten; today they are recognised as pioneers.",
          "One of them, Betty Snyder (later Holberton), went on to help design UNIVAC. Alongside her worked Grace Hopper, a US Navy officer and mathematician who believed programs should be written in something closer to English: she created the first compiler (A-0, 1952) and drove the creation of COBOL (1959), a language still running banks today. Her team also popularised the word 'debugging' after taping an actual moth, found jamming a relay in the Harvard Mark II, into the logbook.",

In 1958–59 Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce independently worked out how to put many transistors on one chip: the integrated circuit. In 1971 Intel squeezed an entire processor onto a single chip — the 4004 microprocessor, with 2,300 transistors. A modern CPU carries tens of billions. Gordon Moore's 1965 observation that transistor counts double roughly every two years — Moore's Law — held for half a century and is the reason the phone in your pocket outcomputes ENIAC by a factor of billions.",
          "Once processors were chips, computers could sit on desks. The MITS Altair 8800 (1975) launched the hobbyist era — and a tiny company called Microsoft, which wrote its BASIC. The Apple II (1977) put computers in homes and schools; the IBM PC 5150 (1981) put them on every office desk and, because IBM published its specifications, created the 'PC-compatible' industry your workstations still descend from. Laptops shrank the desktop; the iPhone (2007) put a networked computer in every pocket; and since the mid-2010s the frontier has been massive parallel hardware — GPUs and AI accelerators in hyperscale data centres — bringing the story full circle to rooms of machinery, just like ENIAC, but a trillion times faster.",

          "Hardware is only half the story. The first programmers set switches and re-plugged cables (ENIAC), then wrote raw machine code — pure numbers — and assembly language, which gave the numbers names. Software as we know it began when languages let humans write something readable and a program translated it for the machine: Grace Hopper's compiler idea gave us FORTRAN (1957) for science and COBOL (1959) for business.",
          "Operating systems emerged in the 1960s so expensive machines could run many jobs; UNIX (1969, Bell Labs) introduced ideas — files, folders, users, permissions, small tools joined together — that live on in Linux, macOS, Android and even Windows. The PC era brought MS-DOS (1981) and then the graphical user interface: invented at Xerox PARC, made famous by the Macintosh (1984) and Windows. In 1991 two things changed everything: Linus Torvalds released Linux, proving world-class software could be built in the open by volunteers, and Tim Berners-Lee released the World Wide Web, turning the internet into a place. Browsers, e-mail and the web made software something you visit, not only something you install.",
          "The 2000s moved software off your machine: web applications, then 'software as a service' (Gmail, Microsoft 365), then app stores (2008) delivering programs to phones. Under it all, virtualisation let one physical server pretend to be many — the software trick that makes cloud computing possible. And the newest layer is AI: machine-learning models, and since 2022 large language models, which are trained on thousands of GPUs and are already part of the support technician's toolkit. Ada Lovelace's prediction — machines working with words, music and ideas, not just numbers — took 180 years to come true.",

Every networked device needs a NIC (network interface card) — today built into every motherboard (Gigabit or 2.5 Gb Ethernet) and every laptop (Wi-Fi). From there, the switch is the heart of the LAN: it connects the devices in a building and forwards traffic only to the port where the destination lives. Unmanaged switches are plug-and-play; managed switches add configuration — VLANs to separate departments, monitoring, and security. PoE (power over Ethernet) switches send electricity down the network cable itself, powering wireless access points, IP cameras and desk phones with no plug point needed.",

The computers themselves are servers — machines built for reliability rather than looks: ECC RAM, redundant hot-swappable power supplies and drives, and a management port (iDRAC/iLO) that lets a technician power, monitor and even reinstall the machine remotely. Servers come as towers (small offices), rack servers (the standard — flat 'pizza boxes' measured in rack units: 1U = 4.45 cm, in 42U cabinets), and blades (many thin servers sharing one chassis's power and networking).",
          "Storage in the data centre outgrows single machines: DAS is storage directly attached to one server; a NAS is a storage appliance serving files over the network (shared folders); a SAN is a dedicated high-speed storage network (Fibre Channel or iSCSI) presenting raw disk volumes to many servers — the storage arrays behind databases and virtual machine farms, full of hot-swappable drives, dual controllers and battery-backed cache.",

Rack-level PDUs (power distribution units) feed each cabinet, ideally from two independent paths (A+B) so one failure drops nothing. Cooling: CRAC units and chilled-water systems push cold air through raised floors or contained hot/cold aisles — servers face cold aisles, exhaust into hot aisles, and containment stops the two mixing. Redundancy is described as N+1 (one spare of everything) or 2N (a complete duplicate), and facilities are graded Tier I–IV on how much can fail without downtime. Add biometric access control, CCTV, fire suppression that won't destroy electronics (inert gas, not water), and environmental sensors watching temperature and humidity — every one of these is hardware someone must support.",

            answer: 1,
            explain: "The EMI filter is like a water filter for electricity — it cleans dirty AC before the rectifier sees it. Converting AC→DC is the rectifier's job, stepping down is the transformer's, and CPU regulation is done by the motherboard VRM.",

            answer: 1,
            explain: "A bridge rectifier is four diodes acting as one-way gates, forcing AC to flow one direction only. In a SA PSU the result is roughly 320 V DC. Chopping is done later by the MOSFETs; smoothing is done by capacitors.",

Franchising is becoming very popular in South Africa; it can be explained as a marriage between a big business and a small business. The franchisor is usually a person or company with a highly marketable product or service. The franchisee is a person or company who is licensed by the franchisor to perform the marketing function and who provides most of the capital required for this purpose. The franchisor achieves rapid expansion at relatively low cost to him.",

Franchising has provided numerous opportunities for individuals to set up a business at relatively low risk. In South Africa today, franchising probably represents one of the best opportunities for aspiring entrepreneurs.

A word processor lets you create a document, store it electronically, display it on a screen, modify it by entering commands and characters from the keyboard, and print it — and in 2026 it also saves your work to the cloud automatically, keeps a version history, and lets several people edit the same document at the same time.",

If you make a typing mistake, you simply back up the cursor and correct it. You can delete a paragraph without leaving a trace, insert a word, sentence or paragraph in the middle of a document, or move sections of text from one place to another — then print or share only when you are happy.",
